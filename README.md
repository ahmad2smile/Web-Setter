Web Setter
=========

# Kind of a boilerplate to just setup the __Folders__ and __Empty Files__ for a simple Web App

It's a simple Powershell script to create: *index.html* css js folders and subfoldered files to start a Web App Development.

### Usage
Run the powershell script...


	.\Web-Setter.ps1

Script starts from "Documents" as the default directory.
Set the directory to move down from the "Documents" directory which would contain your __Project Folder__.

for me it was:

	webDev\reactApp

then Set the name for your __Project Folder__.

for me it was:

	redux-reactApp
